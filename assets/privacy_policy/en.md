## Processing of personal data of users

### General

For all interactions via the application, the services of a BigBlueButton server are used.
The addressed server is defined by the user via the start view (Meeting URL).
All entered and received data is routed through this server and is therefore outside the application's sphere of action.

### Chat messages

The app stores the chat messages sent or received through the app until the application is closed.

### Webcam Stream

If the user shares his webcam with the participants of a conference, these streams are transmitted directly to the BigBlueButton services.
The app stores these streams only temporarily and at most until the application is closed.

### Screenshare Stream

If the user shares his screen, the image data is transferred to the BigBlueButton services.
The app saves the image data at most until the application is closed.

### Audio Stream

If the user shares the audio recorded by the microphone, the data is transmitted directly to the BigBlueButton services.
The recorded data is stored by the app at most until the application is closed.

### Settings

All application settings are stored exclusively locally on the user's device and are deleted at the latest when the application is uninstalled.

## Evaluation of the user behavior

The usage behavior of each user is neither recorded nor analyzed.
However, we can only speak for the App and not for the BigBlueButton services used.

## Transfer of data to third parties

All data entered via the App is transferred to the services of the connected BigBlueButton Server.

## Delete, block and correct user data

To delete all user data, all you need to do is uninstall the app from the user's device.
However, this does not apply to the data transmitted to the BigBlueButton Services while using the App.

## Objection

If you do not agree with the data storage of this app, please delete the app to prevent data storage.
